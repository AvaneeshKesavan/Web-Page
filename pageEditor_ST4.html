                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The Profile webpage is a structured, responsive, and cross-browser-compatible HTML document
                        which intends to showcase a user's personal profile, skills, experience, and volunteering
                        availability. Designed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the layout is grid-based for organized
                        presentation of content. There are three main sections on the page: left (Personal information
                        and skills), middle (biography, goals, and experience), and right (volunteering availability
                        and supported UN goals). Also allows users to enter contact information throught forms. The
                        layout is meant to conformably adapt with the size of various display screens through the use
                        of CSS media queries for a good viewing experience over various devices. The webpage optimally
                        follows modern accessibility and usability practices, making it both appealing to the eye and
                        functional.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>The website has accessible functions that use semantic HTML elements for better compatibility
                        with screen readers, appropriate alt texts for pictures, and easy-to-understand links.
                        The layout is adaptable for mobile users to make it easier to read on small devices. It has
                        been designed to also allow for keyboard navigation and add buttons for expanded functionality
                        that will greatly help users with disabilities.

                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>This HTML document sets up a responsive web page with an SVG-rendered sitemap. It begins by
                        inserting character encoding and viewport meta tags accordingly, for optimal showing within
                        preview windows of all screen sizes and devices. It links to an external stylesheet that
                        governs the webpage with visual styles and includes a favicon for branding purposes. The body
                        of the document contains an SVG-based sitemap layout, which works as an interactive, visual
                        representation of any website structure. This method ensures accessibility and clarity while
                        keeping the entire interface responsive to a very large range of devices.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>This webpage is designed with accessibility in mind. It ensures that all content is clearly
                        structured and easy to navigate for users with disabilities. The SVG sitemap provides a visual
                        representation of the website's structure, while appropriate semantic HTML elements were used
                        to improve screen reader compatibility. Meta tags and proper viewport settings ensure that the
                        page is optimized for both screen sizes and devices, including those used for individuals with
                        visual impairments. Additionally, using external CSS provides a consistent and visually
                        appealing layout while supporting high contrast and other user-defined accessibility settings
                        in browsers.

                    <h2 id="content_page">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>This webpage employs a responsive layout designed with a fixed side navigation menu providing
                        quick links to the most important sections regarding marine ecosystems. In terms of styling,
                        it applies CSS including media queries within an adaptive layout across devices. The hero
                        section has a background image set to fixed attachment and a semi-transparent overlay to make
                        the text stand out. JavaScript adds more dynamic functions like hamburger menu, toggle theme,
                        or search bar. The page consists of semantic HTML tags like the header, section, and footer
                        provided with accessibility considerations, such as the use of alt text for images and an
                        appropriate structure selection of headings. Also, with the help of CSS transitions, the side
                        menu and navigation links are animated interactively.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>This website is designed using accessible layout principles. The semantic HTML elements are
                        easy to identify: header, section, and footer. Text contrast checks out with respect to the
                        background, and there is some alt text for pictures, which renders them compatible with a
                        screen reader. The side navigation menu is keyboard-navigable, and the links are
                        self-explanatory for users with disabilities. The page has also been designed with responsive
                        styles to ensure usability across different screen sizes. Focus styles on dynamic elements such
                        as the hamburger menu and search bar are designed with accessibility in mind to operate with
                        assistive technologies. The content is organized by a proper heading hierarchy, which allows
                        the entire content to be easily navigated.

                    <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>Meanwhile, during the development of this project, I encountered challenges related to creating
                        a seamless and responsive layout across devices. Designing the user profile page required
                        thoughtful consideration of both functionality and aesthetics. On the way to laying out the
                        profile, I ensured its easy navigation while providing space for the necessary information,
                        such as user information and settings. The process involved efficient content structuring
                        for the sitemap. The content page took the challenge of organizing detailed information in
                        a way that was user-friendly yet still visually appealing and clear. The main technical
                        problem involved making the elements responsive. With different screen sizes, maintaining
                        usability in mobile view involved adjustment of layouts and text sizes. Such adjustments
                        included the side navbar, hero section, and content layout to fit different screens without
                        ruining overall design. The second struggle was that of enabling a smooth navigational
                        experience by ensuring all the links were functional and accessible, including compatibility
                        for the sidebar menu across different devices. All in all, these challenges involved balancing
                        design, functionality, and accessibility.
