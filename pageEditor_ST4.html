                                Left (Personal Information & Skills), Middle (Biography, Goals, and Experience), and
                                Right (Volunteering Availability & Supported UN Goals).
                                The layout adapts dynamically to different screen sizes through CSS media queries, ensuring an optimal viewing
                                experience across devices. JavaScript enhances user experience by enabling dynamic
                                elements such as the sidebar navigation. The webpage follows modern accessibility and usability practices,
                                making it both visually appealing and functional.

                            <p>This HTML document creates a responsive webpage featuring a sitemap rendered with SVG.
                                It begins with meta tags to ensure proper character encoding and configure the viewport for optimal
                                display on various screen sizes and devices. The document links to an external CSS stylesheet for consistent
                                visual styling and includes a favicon for branding. The body of the document features an SVG-based sitemap layout,
                                which provides an interactive, visually organized representation of a website‚Äôs structure.
                                This setup ensures both accessibility and clarity while maintaining responsiveness for a wide range of devices.

                                Meta tags and proper viewport settings ensure that the page is optimized for both screen sizes and devices,
                                including those used by individuals with visual impairments. Additionally, the use of external CSS provides

                            <p>This webpage features a responsive layout with a fixed side navigation menu,
                                which provides quick links to key sections related to marine ecosystems.

                                The hero section includes a background image with a fixed attachment and a semi-transparent
                                overlay for text contrast. JavaScript is used for dynamic elements like the hamburger menu,

                                as header, section, and footer, with accessibility considerations such as alt text
                                for images and proper heading structure. Additionally, CSS transitions enhance interactivity in the

                            <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                            <p>During the development of this project, I encountered challenges related to creating a
                                seamless and responsive layout across devices. Designing the user profile page required thoughtful consideration
                                of both functionality and aesthetics. I needed to ensure the profile was easy to navigate,
                                while providing space for the necessary data, such as user information and settings.
                                For the sitemap, I had to structure the content efficiently, ensuring all sections were easily accessible.
                                The content page presented the challenge of organizing detailed information in a user-friendly manner
                                while ensuring visual appeal and clarity.

                                The main technical difficulty was ensuring the elements remained responsive.
                                With varying screen sizes, I had to adjust the layout and text size to maintain usability,
                                especially in the mobile view. This included adjusting the navbar, hero section, and content
                                layout to fit different screens without compromising the overall design. Another hurdle was
                                implementing a smooth navigation experience, ensuring that links were functional and easy to access,
                                which included ensuring compatibility with the sidebar menu for different devices. Overall,
                                these challenges required balancing design, functionality, and accessibility.
