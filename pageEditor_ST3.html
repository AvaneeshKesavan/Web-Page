                    <h2 id="feedback_page">Feedback Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The feedback page features a responsive design with a fixed navigation bar containing a logo,
                         hamburger menu, navigation links, search functionality, profile icon, and theme toggle. 
                        The main content presents a structured feedback form with required fields (name, email, message) 
                        and optional elements including a five-star rating system, category dropdown, and additional questions 
                        about updates and requests. Form elements maintain consistent styling with clear visual hierarchy and 
                        intuitive input methods. The footer includes external UN SDG links with images, comprehensive site navigation,
                        membership information, team member links with JavaScript handlers, and copyright details.
                        The page incorporates three JavaScript files managing navigation, sidebar behavior, and redirects, 
                        while using both global and page-specific CSS for consistent yet customized styling 
                        throughout the interface.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>The feedback page implements several accessibility features including required field indicators,
                        descriptive form labels, and logically structured content for screen reader compatibility. 
                        The rating system uses both star symbols and text descriptions, benefiting users with different 
                        visual capabilities. The form maintains adequate spacing between interactive elements to prevent
                        mis-clicks for those with motor limitations. The theme toggle enhances accessibility by providing 
                        contrast options, while the responsive design ensures usability across devices. However, 
                        improvements could include adding ARIA attributes for more comprehensive screen reader support,
                        enhancing keyboard navigation with clearer focus indicators, and ensuring all interactive 
                        elements have appropriate tab order. The hamburger menu should include an aria-label, 
                        and the star rating system would benefit from additional invisible text for better screen reader
                        context. The search functionality could also include more descriptive labels for 
                        assistive technology users.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="team_page">Team Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The team page implements a responsive design with a fixed navigation bar featuring the TECHASTRIS logo,
                        collapsible hamburger menu for mobile devices, main navigation links with "Team" highlighted as the 
                        active page, an expandable search functionality, profile icon access, and theme toggle button.
                        The content area displays a clean team grid layout with individual member cards that expand
                        when focused. Each team member card follows a consistent design pattern showing a thumbnail image,
                        member name, role designation (Student 01-04), institutional affiliation as Informatics Institute of Technology
                        undergraduates, and three social media connection points (GitHub, Gmail, LinkedIn) with 
                        appropriate aria labels for screen reader support. The cards include tabindex attributes 
                        to ensure keyboard navigability. The page maintains the site's standardized footer structure with external
                        UN SDG links accompanied by organizational images, uppercase site navigation links,
                        a horizontal divider, membership access, team member quick links with JavaScript redirect
                        functionality, and copyright information. The implementation leverages both global
                        and page-specific CSS files for styling consistency while accommodating unique team page elements,
                        and incorporates three JavaScript files managing navigation behavior, sidebar functionality,
                        and member-specific redirects for a seamless user experience.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>The team page incorporates several accessibility features including proper HTML structure with language attributes, 
                        tabindex attributes on team member cards for keyboard navigation, descriptive aria-labels on social media links,
                        alt text for images, and visual indication of the active navigation item. However, several improvements would 
                        enhance accessibility: the hamburger menu lacks an aria-label for screen reader context, social media icons
                        with fixed 40px widths may create touch targets too small for users with motor impairments, onclick JavaScript 
                        handlers in the footer should be replaced with proper link functionality for better assistive technology support, 
                        color contrast should be verified for WCAG compliance, focus indicators could be more visible during keyboard
                        navigation, and ARIA landmarks would improve screen reader navigation through the page structure. Additionally, 
                        some image alt texts could be more descriptive, and the cards' interaction model should ensure all functionality
                        is available to keyboard-only users, particularly when viewing team member details that might be designed
                        primarily for mouse hover interactions.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="contents">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The Human Impact content page incorporates an advanced HTML5 structure with comprehensive
                        metadata and multiple linked stylesheets. The header section includes a custom inline 
                        style block defining a fixed-attachment hero section with a background image specific to the 
                        human impact theme. The navigation system maintains site-wide consistency with a logo, hamburger
                        menu for mobile devices, primary navigation links, search functionality, profile access, and theme toggle. 
                        The hero section features a full-width background image with fixed attachment for parallax 
                        scrolling effect, containing a prominently centered heading that establishes the page topic.
                        <br>
                        The page implements a sophisticated side navigation system with a toggle button that allows users to
                        show or hide the quick links menu. This side navbar provides anchor links to each major section of
                        the content, enabling efficient page navigation. The toggle functionality is controlled via JavaScript,
                        allowing the sidebar to adapt to different screen sizes and viewing preferences. The main content 
                        is organized into well-structured sections with semantic heading tags (h2) serving as anchors for 
                        the sidebar navigation, creating a cohesive information architecture throughout the page.
                        <br>
                        The content is presented in a scholarly format with substantial text blocks explaining different aspects
                        of human impact on marine environments. Each major section (Introduction, Pollution, Overexploitation,
                        and Climate Change) follows a consistent pattern with a heading, multiple paragraphs of detailed information,
                        and a relevant supporting image. The text content is comprehensive and educational, with specific statistics 
                        and examples supporting the environmental narrative. Images are strategically placed at the end of each 
                        section to visually reinforce the written content, with appropriate alt text for accessibility.
                        <br>
                        The page maintains the site's standard footer structure with external UN SDG links,
                        site navigation options, membership access, team member links with JavaScript redirect handlers, 
                        and copyright information. The implementation includes three JavaScript files handling navigation
                        behavior, sidebar functionality, and redirects. The overall architecture balances information density
                        with readability, using whitespace, paragraph breaks, and visual elements to create an engaging educational 
                        experience. The page design demonstrates attention to both aesthetic presentation and information architecture,
                        leveraging fixed-position elements, responsive design techniques, and interactive components to enhance user
                        engagement with serious environmental content.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility is improved by ensuring proper text alignment, readable font sizes, and sufficient
                        color contrast for text elements. The sticky side navigation bar makes it easier for users to
                        access different sections without scrolling too much. The hover effect on navigation links
                        provides a visual indicator of interactivity. Responsive design adjustments ensure the content
                        remains readable and usable on mobile devices. Images are scaled properly, preventing layout
                        shifts that could affect users navigating with screen readers or keyboards.</p>

                    <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>The team page and feedback form implementation faced several technical hurdles. Navigation consistency 
                        across pages required careful CSS architecture to handle active states and responsive behaviors.
                        The feedback form needed intuitive validation while maintaining user-friendly error handling.
                        Responsive design demanded precise breakpoints to accommodate varying screen sizes, especially 
                        for team member cards and form elements. Interactive components like the expandable search bar 
                        and theme toggle required efficient JavaScript event handling with smooth animations.
                        <br>
                        Accessibility implementation presented significant challenges. Creating keyboard-navigable team cards while
                        preserving visual design required careful focus state management. Adding appropriate ARIA labels throughout 
                        both pages demanded understanding of screen reader behavior. The star rating system needed to be both 
                        visually appealing and accessible. Form validation errors had to be communicated through multiple channels
                        beyond visual cues. The theme toggle feature required maintaining sufficient contrast in both light and dark
                        modes to ensure readability for all users.
