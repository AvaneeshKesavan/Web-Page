                <!-- Update those first three sections for the pages you were responsible to implement -->

                <section>
                    <h2 id="home">Home Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The home page is designed with a fixed navigation bar that includes a logo, menu links, a profile
                        icon, and a theme toggle button, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes. The hero
                        section features a background GIF with a dark overlay to improve readability, along with a large
                        heading, a short description, and a call-to-action button that redirects users to more
                        information. The mission section is structured with a bordered container and a subtle shadow
                        effect for emphasis. The gallery section incorporates interactive image tiles that change on
                        hover, making the user experience more engaging while linking to various content pages. The
                        search functionality is implemented with a smooth slide-in and slide-out animation, keeping the
                        interface clean and user-friendly. A sticky theme button ensures users can toggle themes at any
                        time, enhancing customization options. The footer contains essential links, external references
                        (such as the UN SDG 14 page), and additional navigation options with team member names. CSS
                        media queries are used to ensure responsiveness across different devices, adjusting text sizes,
                        button padding, and layouts dynamically.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>The website follows good accessibility practices by ensuring high-contrast text, clear hover
                        effects on links, and a structured layout that enhances screen reader compatibility. The dark
                        overlay on the hero section‚Äôs background GIF improves text readability for users with visual
                        impairments. The navigation bar is designed to be keyboard-accessible, and buttons have
                        sufficient spacing for easy interaction. The search bar animation allows smooth transitions
                        without sudden movement, reducing discomfort for users with motion sensitivity. However, further
                        improvements could be made by adding ARIA attributes for better screen reader support, enhancing
                        keyboard navigation by ensuring all interactive elements are easily focusable, and providing
                        alternative text for images in the gallery section to improve usability for visually impaired
                        users. Additionally, ensuring that the theme toggle button has an accessible label would further
                        improve usability.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="table">Table Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The membership section inside #content presents a structured membership table with three pricing
                        tiers: Basic, Standard, and Premium. The table organizes features in rows and membership plans
                        in columns, improving readability.
                        <br>
                        The .membership-table class sets the table‚Äôs width to 80%, centers it, and applies
                        border-collapse: collapse to merge borders for a cleaner look. It has a dark background
                        (#0F172A), with column headers given distinct background colors (#48cae4, #00b4d8, #0096c7) to
                        visually differentiate plans. The border-radius: 10px and box-shadow enhance the modern
                        aesthetic.
                        <br>
                        Table cells (td) are styled with padding: 20px for spacing and border: 1px solid #3B3F58 to
                        define sections. Plan logos and checkmarks use images, centrally aligned with display: block;
                        margin: 0 auto; for better positioning.
                        <br>
                        Join buttons (.join-btn) are styled with a white background, black text, and rounded corners.
                        The hover effect swaps colors (background-color: black; color: white;) to indicate
                        interactivity.
                        <br>
                        A .zebra-row class is used for alternating row colors (background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255,
                        0.1);), improving readability. The .highlight class is applied to special messages with a
                        gold-tinted background.
                        <br>
                        Responsive design (@media (max-width: 768px)) adjusts the table width to 95%, reduces padding,
                        and resizes text for better display on smaller screens.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>The page ensures accessibility through high contrast text colors, clear font choices, and
                        well-structured content. The dark mode feature (.dark-mode) ensures readability by switching
                        text colors dynamically. The table structure allows screen readers to navigate easily, and
                        tooltips (title attributes on images) provide extra context. Interactive elements like buttons
                        have clear hover effects, improving usability. Responsive design ensures the table remains
                        accessible across different devices, avoiding horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.</p>

                    <h2 id="contents">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                    <p>The content section is styled using a .container class, which limits the width of the section and
                        centers it on the page. The #content ID shifts the section to the right (margin-left: 200px) and
                        moves it upward (margin-top: -35%). The text in the .hero-section-text is positioned relative to
                        ensure it aligns properly within the section.
                        <br>
                        A side navigation bar (.side-navbar) is placed on the left side using position: sticky, keeping
                        it fixed as the user scrolls. It has a background color, padding, and a box shadow to enhance
                        visibility. Inside, an unordered list (ul) organizes navigation links, which change color on
                        hover for better interactivity.
                        <br>
                        The section headings (.heading-section and .section) use larger font sizes and colors to make
                        them stand out. The paragraph text inside .container p is justified for readability, and images
                        inside .container img are centered and resized to fit well within the section.
                        <br>
                        A responsive design is implemented using media queries (@media screen and (max-width: 786px)).
                        On smaller screens, the content section‚Äôs margin is adjusted, the side navbar turns into a
                        hidden menu that slides out when activated, and images resize dynamically to maintain a clean
                        layout.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                    <p>Accessibility is improved by ensuring proper text alignment, readable font sizes, and sufficient
                        color contrast for text elements. The sticky side navigation bar makes it easier for users to
                        access different sections without scrolling too much. The hover effect on navigation links
                        provides a visual indicator of interactivity. Responsive design adjustments ensure the content
                        remains readable and usable on mobile devices. Images are scaled properly, preventing layout
                        shifts that could affect users navigating with screen readers or keyboards.</p>

                    <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>During the implementation process, we faced challenges in designing a responsive layout,
                        maintaining consistency across different pages, and ensuring accessibility. Structuring the home
                        page, table page, and content page required careful planning to keep the design clean and
                        user-friendly.
                        <br>
                        Through this process, we learned the importance of maintaining a structured layout, testing for
                        responsiveness early, and considering accessibility from the start. These lessons will help in
                        creating more user-friendly and visually consistent web pages in the future.
