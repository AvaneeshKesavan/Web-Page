            <h2 id="splash">Splash page</h2>
            <h3>Technical Description</h3>
            <p>
              The splash screen is designed to provide a visually appealing page
              while the main content is loading. The background of the page is
              set using background-image css property on the body to a image of
              underwater animals aligning with the style & theme of the website.
              The text content is then centered within the page using flexbox.
              Furthermore, a GIF is used to indicate that the page is loading to
              the user. Semi-transparent overlay is used to make the loading
              icon and text content more visible and readable.
              <br />
              <br />
              Finally, a 5-second delayed redirect to the home (home.html) page
              has been implemented using the http-equiv attribute on a meta tag.
            </p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The splash page ensures accessibility by providing high contrast
              between text and background using a dark overlay, and a simple
              layout. The loading icon is animated to provide visual feedback to
              users while the page is loading, and features an alt attribute for
              screen readers. The text content is centered and easy to read,
              ensuring a positive user experience. The 5-second delay before
              redirecting to the home page gives users enough time to view the
              splash screen content.

            <h3>Technical Description</h3>
            <p>
              The volunteer page is designed to provide information about
              programs and opportunities for users to get involved in
              volunteering efforts. The program filter is created using a html
              select element. The pagination bar is structured using Flexbox,
              utilizing the justify-content property to align the current page
              indicator to left and the page number and navigation buttons to
              the right.
              <br />
              <br />
              Volunteer cards are aligned using the grid layout. The card
              themselves are styled using a box-shadow, border-radius, and
              padding to make them visually appealing. The card feature a
              Thumbnail image at the top, followed by the title & description.
              The footer uses flexbox and justify-content to align the rating
              and country to the left and apply and View project buttons to the
              right
              <br />
              <br />
              Registration, Overall ratings and the feedback form is present at
              the end of the page
            </p>

            <h3>Accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              The volunteer page ensures accessibility by providing high
              contrast between text and background, readable font sizes, and a
              clean layout. The program filter is easy to use and navigate, and
              the pagination bar is clearly labeled. Volunteer cards are
              visually appealing and easy to read, with alt text for images and
              descriptive text for links. Furthermore, the card grid adapts it
              number of columns using css media queries for different sizes
              screens. The registration form and feedback form are accessible to
              users with screen readers and keyboards, with proper labels and
              input fields. The page is responsive and adapts well to different
              screen sizes, ensuring a positive user experience for all users.

            <p>
              During the development of my assigned pages, i faced several
              challenges. The most significant challenge was ensuring that the
              pages were responsive on all types of devices and screen sizes.
              This required testing and debugging each of my assigned page on
              different screen sizes using the browser dev tools. Furthermore,
              ensuring that the pages were accessible to all users was another
              challenge. I had to make sure that the pages had proper alt text
              for images, readable font sizes, and high contrast between text
              and background. This required me to research accessibility best
              practices and implement them throughout the pages.
